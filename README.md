# CircleK Rock Paper Scissors Battler
Chrome extension to battle CircleK's Rock Paper Scissors game without feeling shame when you lose

CircleK's Rock Paper Scissors is a promotion where you play 3 games of rock paper scissors daily, and if you win 1, you can redeem a prize at your local CircleK.
It's a fun concept until you realize it's **rigged.**

In order to still **win prizes**, but **without the shame**, I made a chrome extension that plays for me. When it wins, it feels cool that a bot beat another bot. When it loses, the extension is stupid, not me. It's a win-win situation :)
