# CircleK Rock Paper Scissors Battler
Chrome extension to battle CircleK's Rock Paper Scissors game without feeling shame when you lose

[CircleK's Rock Paper Scissors](https://games.circlek.com/ca/rock-paper-prizes) is a promotion where you play 3 games of rock paper scissors daily, and if you win 1, you can redeem a prize at your local CircleK.
It's a fun concept until you realize it's **rigged.**

In order to still **WIN prizes**, but **WITHOUT the shame**, I made a chrome extension that plays for me. When it **wins**, it feels cool that a bot beat another bot. When it **loses**, the extension is stupid, **not me**. It's a win-win situation :)
